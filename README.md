# HighValueCustomers
Imagine you work as data scientist at a mall, and the owners of the mall want to identify target customers, (people that have a lot of money and spend a lot of it as well). You've gathered some data from the mall's customers, namely, their age, gender, annual income and a spending score.  The spending score is a score that the mall has assigned to the customers based on their spending behaviour, (scale 1 - 100). You proceed to perform clustering on the data with K-Means algorithm to perform customer segmentation and identify the target audience.
